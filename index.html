<p>Eren Yeager is the main protagonist of *Attack on Titan*, a popular anime and manga series created by Hajime Isayama. He begins as a passionate and idealistic young man, determined to protect his friends and family from the titans, giant humanoid creatures that have ravaged humanity.

His desire to end the titan threat eventually leads him to uncover deeper conspiracies and hidden truths about the world and his own identity.
    
    Eren is known for his determination and unyielding will, but also for his willingness to make extreme choices in pursuit of his goals, which causes tension with his allies and friends. His journey is a central driving force in *Attack on Titan*, and his actions challenge the definitions of heroism and villainy in the story. His character has sparked much discussion and debate among fans, particularly regarding his ultimate decisions and the implications for the world of *Attack on Titan*.
